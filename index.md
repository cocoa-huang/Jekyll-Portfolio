## Hello! 你好！
{{ site.description }}

This is a practice about how to build and deploy a website using Jekyll and Github Page. Using this practice, I want to build some sort of portfolio "about me" website so that people can get to know me better.

See my resume to get to know my professional interests! [Click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1llkPXRagkyi-MJBNAj-NiW51TSE9b7cg/view?usp=sharing).

Connect me on social media to know me better!
